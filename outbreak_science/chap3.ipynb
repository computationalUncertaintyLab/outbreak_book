    "#### The SIR compartmental model \n",
    "In what follows below, we'll derive the SIR compartmental model for frequency and density-dependent tranmission.\n",
    "The SIR model is a **deterministic**---re-running the model for the same initial conditions and same parameter values produces the same output---description of how animals (humans are animals) move between three disease states: susceptible, infected, and recovered/removed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### From S into I ($S \\to I$)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a susceptible individual to become infected, we must assess the probability that they contact an infected individual and the probability that an infected individual sucussfully tranmits the pathogen to the suscpetible individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a single susceptible individual, out of a total of $N$ individuals in the system, comes into contact with $C$ other individuals on average in a small interval of time called $\\Delta t$.\n",
    "For example, $\\Delta t$ might be a day or hours. \n",
    "Then the average number of times that they contact an infector in this time interval is $C \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} \\cdot \\Delta t$. \n",
    "Let $p$ denote the probability of transmission, or the probability that when an infector contacts a susceptible that transmit the pathogen. \n",
    "Then the probability that a susceptible is infected equals \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    1 - (1-p)^{ C \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} \\cdot \\Delta t }. \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the the Reed-Frost model, we can approximate the above as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    1 - (1-p)^{ C \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} } &\\approx 1 - e^{ -p \\cdot C \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} \\cdot \\Delta t} \\\\ \n",
    "                                      &\\approx  \\left(p \\cdot C\\right) \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} \\cdot \\Delta t \\\\ \n",

    "\n",
    "where we replaced the average number of contacts that result in transmission $pC$ with the parameter $\\beta$. \n",
    "The above expression is the average probability at which a single susceptible individual is infected. \n",
    "If there are $S$ susceptible individuals making independent $C$ contacts over $\\Delta t$ then the average number of susceptibles to move to the infected state (new infections or $\\Delta I$) is \n",

    "   \\frac{dI}{dt} &= S \\beta \\frac{I}{N} ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ is read \"The derivative of I with respect to time\" and is meant to express the change in the average number of infectors for a small unit of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### From I into R  ($I \\to R$)\n",
    "\n",
    "For many pathogens, we assume that an individual is infected for a finite amount of time called the infectious duration ($1/\\gamma$). \n",
    "For example, we might find (from a clinical or laboratory study) that the pathgoen of study on average causes an individual to be infectious for 4 days.\n",
    "In this case, $1/\\gamma = $ 4 days per one person to move out of the infected state.\n",
    "We can also look at the reciprocal, $\\gamma = 1/4$, as the number of people that move out of the infected state per single day. In our example, \"1/4\" individuals move out of the infected state.  \n",
    "If on the other hand $1/\\gamma = 1/2$ then we would expect $\\gamma=2$ individuals per day to move out of the infected state in one time unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that after the infectious duration is complete then individuals move from the infectious disease state $I$ to the removed or recovered disease state $R$. \n",
    "That is, we assume that within a small time interval $\\Delta t$\n",

    "#### Frequency vs Density Dependent Transmission \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of transmission: frequency and density dependent transmission. \n",
    "Frequency dependent transmission assumes that the average number of contacts between any two individuals is a constant, and independent of density.\n",
    "In human populations, this is typically justified because of limits on social mixing. \n",
    "We expect that one individual typically interacts with the same, average number of other humans. \n",
    "Density-dependent transmission assumes that the number of contacts depends on the population density $\\rho$ (usually linearly). \n",
    "If tranmission is expected to occur because of crowding between individuals or because of 'every day' occurances between individuals then density-dependent transmssion is more reasonable to assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets translate the above into mathematics and the above SIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the fixed, $N$ individuals in our system can be captured in a space (you can assume a square) with area equal to $A$.\n",
    "We define the density, $\\rho$, as the number of individuals per unit area or \n",
