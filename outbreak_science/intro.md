# Outbreak science and public health forecasting

This course aims to introduce students to models that describe the spread of a pathogen through a population, and how models can support public health decisions. The course will be split into four parts: (1) the factors that motivate public health actions, (2) epidemic models such as the Reed-Frost and SIR, (3) statistical time series and forecasts, (4) a focus on ensemble building. Students will be expected to complete mathematical/statistical exercises and write code that simulates infectious processes.
