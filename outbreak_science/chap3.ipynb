    "For example, $\\Delta t$ might be a day or hours. \n",
    "Then the average number of times that they contact an infector in this time interval is $C \\cdot \\frac{I}{N} \\cdot \\Delta t$. \n",
    "Let $p$ denote the probability of transmission, or the probability that when an infector contacts a susceptible that transmit the pathogen. \n",
