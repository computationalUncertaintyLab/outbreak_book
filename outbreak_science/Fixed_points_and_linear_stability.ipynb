    "Compartmental models like the SIR model are highly flexible. \n",
    "The modeler can add compartments that allow animals to belong to other disease states (e.g. hospitalization, death, subtypes of infection, etc.), and they can model parameters that depend on time or on covariates (e.g. influenza is thought to depend on the specific humidity in the environment).  \n",
