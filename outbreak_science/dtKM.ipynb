    "The SIR model implicitly assumes that the density of infectious periods is exponential. \n",
    "To see this, for a small increment of time $\\tau$, we assume an individual leaves the infectious state with probability $\\gamma \\tau$. This means that an individual remains infectious for this small period of time $\\tau$ with probability $1-\\gamma \\tau$.\n",
